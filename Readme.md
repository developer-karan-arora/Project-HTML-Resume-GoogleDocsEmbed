## Project-HTML-Resume-GoogleDocsEmbed   
    
    A really simple process    
    You can access it using this url :-   https://devloper-krn.github.io/Project-HTML-Resume-GoogleDocsEmbed/ 
    
I have just deployed my simple resume over github    
Just using an iframe tag and posting a softcopy of that resume over google docs
