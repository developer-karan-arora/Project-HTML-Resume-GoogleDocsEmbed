## Project-HTML-Resume-GoogleDocsEmbed   
    
    A really simple process    
    
    I have just deployed my simple resume over github     
    Just using an iframe tag and posting a softcopy of that resume over google docs   
    

You can access it using this url :-   https://devloper-krn.github.io/Project-HTML-Resume-GoogleDocsEmbed/
